<h3>Broken Homes &#38; Broken Hearts: Offering New Hope to Children of&#160;Divorce</h3>
<h4>Michael Coggin</h4>
<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/6.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Michael Coggin"/>
<p>The impact of divorce on children, the family, the church, and the greater culture has been grossly underestimated. The cultural message communicated to today’s children and families is that divorce isn’t a big deal. In reality divorce is a life-transforming experience that is a watershed moment in the heart of a child. How are we as parents, youth leaders, and counselors to come alongside these children? What hope for healing is there for families dealing with this loss? </p>

<h3>Fighting&#160;Fair</h3>
<h4>Matt &amp; Cheri Uldrich</h4>
<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/12.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Matt &amp; Cheri Uldrich"/>
<p>Do you feel like the simplest of tasks and the easiest of conversations turn into pitiful fights? Does every discussion after 8 p.m. mean you have to put on boxing gloves and choose a corner? You get the corner by the phone; I will take the corner of the kitchen by the keys to the car that are hung up on the wall (in case I want to leave) because this one is going fifteen rounds! </p>
<p>Can we really fight for the glory of God or is that a monastic pipe dream? Can these passions of mine (good, bad, &#38; ugly) be used positively? We believe that fighting can be done to the glory of God and dare we say …redemptive, intimate, healing, honest, and good! Learn to view differences of opinion as opportunities to live out the Gospel of grace.</p>

<h3>Flatter Abs, Bigger Biceps, Lonely&#160;Hearts</h3>
<h4>Travis Stewart</h4>

<p><em>Body Image</em><br/>
Everywhere we look we see perfect bodies…and we feel like we got the short end of the stick. This is even more true for our children who are more exposed to the media as well as going through the changes of puberty and growth. These struggles with body image can lead to a host of problems, for boys and girls, including laxative and steroid abuse, depression, self-harm and eating disorders. This seminar will cover the biblical understanding of the body, media distortion, underlying issues and practical tips for equipping your children (and yourself) in this vital area of health.</p>

<h3>Listening for Life: Picking Up on Verbal and Non-Verbal&#160;Signals</h3>
<h4>Michael Coggin</h4>
<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/6.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Michael Coggin"/>
<p>There is a youth subculture – a subculture with its own mores, ethics, and language. No wonder adults have communication miscues with adolescents. Verbal communication with adolescents is not only infrequent but often strained and difficult. How do adolescents communicate? What are some of the barriers to communicating with adolescents? How do we listen to and interpret the verbal and non-verbal clues? What might these clues be communicating? How do we listen as parents? </p>

<p>In our time together, we’ll discuss preparing your child for college, walking through those years together, and what to expect in the post-college years. We’ll look at the current state of college campuses and try to understand this generation’s struggles to live out faith in that context. We will attempt to weave together biblical, practical and experiential aspects – and of course take questions.</p>

<h3>The Family&#160;Table</h3>
<h4>Travis Stewart</h4>
<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/9.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Travis Stewart"/>
<p><em>Relating as a family to help protect your kids from eating disorders and other destructive behaviors.</em><br/>
Alcohol abuse, drug use, pre-marital sexual activity and Eating Disorders. None of these (or other dangerous behaviors) develop in a vacuum. Peer pressure, media, and trauma all can have an impact on whether or not our kids will engage in these behaviors. But, perhaps nothing will influence their behaviors more than the family setting. Travis, who daily works with adolescents and their families facing eating disorders (as well as many of these other behaviors), will share insights into how the family system impacts and is affected by these behaviors. Not limited to Eating Disorders alone &#8211; but specifically geared toward them &#8211; this workshop will help you understand what your child’s behaviors may have to do with how you live family life and how to love them to health.</p>

<h3>The Organized&#160;Parent</h3>
<h4>Susan Stewart</h4>
<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/8.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Susan Stewart"/>
<p>Safe, loving, encouraging. These are a few of the things we want our homes and families to reflect. Unfortunately life with children is much more chaotic with toys strewn across the floor, dishes stacked in the sink and school papers scattered throughout the house. This workshop will equip you with practical and realistic organizing skills so that you can spend more time and energy shaping your children into followers of Christ.</p>

<h3>The Power of Storytelling - Connecting with your Kids through&#160;Story.</h3>
<h4>Matt &amp; Cheri Uldrich</h4>
<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/12.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Matt &amp; Cheri Uldrich"/>
<p>All of history is the drama of His Story of Redemption. You have untapped imagination, shelved stories warehoused in the darkest crevices of your mind, and the whole biblical narrative from which to draw upon to disciple your child. Could it be that all the highlights and heartaches of your “growing up years” could be a connecting point for you and your child as you try to show them the Father? We believe the answer is YES! This seminar will get you thinking about ways to reach, relate, and respond to your child through story. Jesus blessed you with children; now use the drama of your life and His to bring your child face to face with Jesus.</p>

<img src="http://www.parentinginthepresent.org/images/9.jpg" class="imgright" alt="Travis Stewart"/>
<p><em>When and How to get Help for Someone with an Eating Disorder</em><br/>
Travis works with parents who are at the end of their rope. They’ve brought their daughter to a treatment center for Anorexia and Bulimia in the middle of the desert in Arizona in an attempt to save their lives. “Why don’t you just eat?!” is just one of the many approaches they’ve tried in getting their daughters to health…to no avail. Is there anything that can be done to help short of sending your child off to treatment? Are their signs of an eating disorder that can help you spot trouble early? When should you seek professional help? Is there really anything you can do? This seminar will help you understand the complex nature of Eating Disorders and what steps to take to get someone the help they need.</p>
